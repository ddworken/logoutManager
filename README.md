# x1 Carbon Scripts
A series of simple scripts to make linux run better on my x1 carbon. 

```logout.py``` should be run at boot so the computer will log out when you close the lid. 

```max``` and ```min``` can be run to easily adjust the max and minimum CPU frequencies. 

```wifi``` should be manually run whenever the wifi is refusing to reconnect after waking up from sleep.
